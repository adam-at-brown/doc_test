### General Styles

    * Background of “primary” buttons are official Brown Brown (#4e3629) with white text and icon
    * Secondary buttons are brown outline and text with white fill
  * Dark mode
    * Primary and secondary buttons both the same - Brown Taupe background #B7B09C with black text
* If buttons are floating over the bottom of the screen (for example, on card balances, today@brown) they should have a block of background color behind them (so when you are scrolling you don’t see the page contents behind them)
* Disabled buttons should be at 50% opacity if disabled (the text should remain at full opacity) This doesn't need to pass accessibility - according to WCAG "Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component."
